Hello! My name is Julia Fraczek, and Iâ€™m a current graduate student at ISU studying music therapy. I'm 23, and I like to sing, play guitar, and piano. I'm originally from Grosse Ile, Michigan, but moved to Bowling Green, OH to do my undergrad at Bowling Green State University. There, I double majored in both psychology and music, and also had the chance to co-direct an a cappella group. I came right from undergrad to do my Master's at ISU. I'm currently working on my thesis, which involves using music-assisted relaxation over videoconferencing, and seeing if this is feasible for professionals to use.
